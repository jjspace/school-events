// an event for. It will also ensure proper order as it searches day
// by day instead of relying on the object's keys being ordered
// correctly in the first place in the `for x in y`

// make sure to have max days to prevent something like 200 empty days
// in the timeline from something due next year
// maybe have extra loop to put after a ... in timeline for 
// extra "future" events past max days
